# IPTV
just random IPTV channels I find, better to have a collection. You can also use this as a sample for your own m3u files.

## Channel organisation
**First section**: 
- Montenegrin public television, RTCG 1, 2, SAT, no Parliament for now :(
- Channels from Yugoslavia, such as HRT, N1 Serbia, Al Jazeera Balkans, TV Slovenia
- Italian channels (Rai 1 and 3 for now)

**Second section**:
- Local channels from the Northeastern US Tri-state Area (mainly New York)
- US national, US local streaming and general international channels

*US national will probably have its own section soon, as local tristate channels are done, so my next goal is getting some US national channels*
