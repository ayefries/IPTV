# IPTV
Various IPTV channels I find. If it's not enough for you, move on. This list prefers quality, and not quantity.

## Channel organisation / tvg groups
**🇲🇪 / 🇪🇺 / 🌍 Section 1**:
- Montenegrin channels
- Channels from ex-Yugoslavia
- Channels from the rest of Europe
- International channels

**🇺🇸 Section 2:**
- US - NY broadcast channels
- US cable and streaming channels

## Rules - When is a channel "good quality"
**Channels are not judged politically.** Despite my political views opposing channels like Fox News Channel and Serbian state-collaborating media, I still include them due to others' preferences and generally having more channels.

**Channels have to be at least SD.**
SD is:
- 480 height on NTSC (used in North America and most of its Asian allies)
- 576 height on PAL (used in most of the world, such as Europe)
- 576 height on SECAM (used in France, its colonies and most ex-colonies, ex-USSR, parts of Africa)

**Channels have to have sound.** Pretty self-explanatory.

**Channels have to load universally.**
Xtream, tokened, geo-blocked, or links that just don't play in Safari won't be added.
Unlike those annoying, ad-filled IPTV sites, I'm a normal person and am not bothered to fuck around with those links.

There, there's your readme.

Hope you enjoy the channels :)
